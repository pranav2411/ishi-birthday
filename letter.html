  <h1>💌 My Letter to You, Ishita</h1>

  <div class="message-box">
    <p>Dear Ishita,</p>

    <p>On your special day, I want to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. You are not just a part of my life — you are my whole world. Every smile you share, every laugh we have, every memory we create is a treasure I hold close to my heart.</p>

    <p>You bring sunshine even to my cloudiest days. Your kindness, your strength, and your beautiful soul inspire me every day. I never believed in soulmates until I met you, and now I can't imagine a future without your hand in mine.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being you — for being my person, my happiness, my peace. I promise to always support you, cherish you, and love you with all that I am.</p>

    <p>Happy Birthday, my love. Here's to you, to us, and to forever. 💖</p>

    <p>With all my love,</p>
    <p><strong>Your one and only ❤️</strong></p>
